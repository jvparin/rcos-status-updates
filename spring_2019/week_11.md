## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week, I was working on issue (#530), but unfortunately, I still was not able to figure out how to do it.
So, as a temporary logical front-end "fix", the "new event assignment" button is now changed to "Create New Event" 
to match its current behavior and unneeded controllers were deleted 
(these changes are in the Event User Flow Fixes pull request: https://github.com/rcos/venue/pull/529). 
Ideally, it should still be called "new event assignment" button and changing its behavior to edit the section assignments 
for that corresponding event that exists.

## This Week's Plans

After my accomplishments from last week, I can finally say that I am officially done with my 
co-terminal grad school year! I'm planning to walk in the graduation ceremony this May. :)

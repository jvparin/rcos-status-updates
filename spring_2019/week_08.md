## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week, I added the minor front end css fixes into the pull request for the "course-list-view" branch based on 
the feedback given by the reviewer (Varun), so this should be good to go in terms of merging it into the dev branch.
I also continued to work on issue #518 and finally was able to combine two forms onto one page. I made a pull request
to fix this issue as well as issue #517, shown in the following link: https://github.com/rcos/venue/pull/529
This change would also affect the flow when a user clicks on the "New event assignment" button if the user wishes to edit the current section assignments after the event has been created. As of right now (and what it has always been), this button goes to the new events page to create a new event instead of editing the section assignments for the currently existing event. Since this is a separate issue, this pull request will not take care of it. Hopefully, a new issue can be made that focuses on this.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to work on any feedback from the reviewer on the pull request for issues #517 and #518. 
I also plan to look at the other issues that I can work on before the semester ends. I can possibly try to work on the new issue
that I mentioned above, but due to my lack of knowledge on this issue, this might take a while to do.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

There is nothing blocking me as of right now.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I have no extra notes as of right now.

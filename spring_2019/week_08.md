## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

the feedback given by the reviewer (Varun), so this should be good to go in terms of merging it into the dev branch.
I also continued to work on issue #518 and finally was able to combine two forms onto one page. I made a pull request 
for this shown with this link:

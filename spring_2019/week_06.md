## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week, I worked on issues #517 and #518 which help fix and minimize the user flow for events. 
The solution to these problems mainly involves combining both the create and assign event controllers 
into one controller (just create) under the eventform module. This week, I was able to change the instructor 
user flow from selecting an event (after clicking the "New Event" button) on the "Events" page to creating an event, 
which minimizes the user flow and fixes issue #517. I am currently working on combining the create and assign event 
controllers and eventually deleting the assign event controller as it is not needed for the reduced user flow for instructors.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to continue to work on issue #518. 
I hope to make a pull request on the "event-user-flow-fixes" branch (https://github.com/rcos/venue/tree/event-user-flow-fixes) 
to fix issue #517 and #518.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week, I continued to work on issue #518 which help fix and minimize the user flow for events.
I am still having trouble with combining the create and assign event controllers as the assign event controller
is dependent on one of the scope variables ids of the create event controller. I am looking into the 'Auth.getCurrentUser()'
info to see if it is possible to obtain the same information from that.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to continue to work on issue #518. 
I hope to make a pull request on the "event-user-flow-fixes" branch (https://github.com/rcos/venue/tree/event-user-flow-fixes) 
to fix issue #517 and #518. Additionally, I will add minor front end css fixes to the "course-list-view" branch by left justifying
course descriptions so that the pull request can be approved and merged into the dev branch.

## Anything Blocking?

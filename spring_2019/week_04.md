## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week, I've been working on issue #498 on this branch: https://github.com/rcos/venue/tree/course-list-view
Since the list feature for Courses is very similar to the list feature for Submissions, the implementation of it did not take too long to do.
After writing this, I'll be making a pull request for this branch to merge into the dev branch. Please provide any
feedback on how you want the view of it to look!

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to work on any feedback for issue #498 and possibly look at other issues to tackle.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

There is nothing blocking me as of right now.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I have no extra notes as of right now.

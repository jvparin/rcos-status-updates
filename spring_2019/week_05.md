## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week after and the week before Spring Break, I made a pull request for issue/feature #498 on the branch: https://github.com/rcos/venue/tree/course-list-view.
I updated the pull request recently and changed the view of the description text for each course under the list view. It now hides
the text by default just like it is in the submission list view and shows the description text when the user clicks on the "show" button.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to work on issues #517 and #518 which help fix and minimize the user flow for events.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

There is nothing blocking me as of right now.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I have no extra notes as of right now.

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week, I was working on issue (#530), but it seems more difficult than what I expected.
I am having an issue of relating the assign-event directive to the corresponding new-event-assignment 
controller I created and having an issue of obtaining the current sections assigned to an 
existing event. Besides this, I also worked on the slides for our final presentation for Venue 
this week.

## This Week's Plans

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to work on any feedback from the reviewer on the pull request for issues #517 and #518. 
I also will continue to work on issue (#530).

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

There is nothing blocking me as of right now. The only thing that's really blocking is the approval of my pull requests so they can be merged
into the dev branch.

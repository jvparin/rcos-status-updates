## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

This week, I added a new issue (#530) that relates to changing the link for the "New Event Assignment" button to the assign-event page
rather than the new-event page, which it originally does. I've been working on this issue and will continue to work on this issue
this week.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to work on any feedback from the reviewer on the pull request for issues #517 and #518. 
I also plan to work on the new issue I made (#530) and work on the slides for the final presentation for Venue.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

There is nothing blocking me as of right now. The only thing that's really blocking is the approval of my pull requests so they can be merged
into the dev branch.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I have no extra notes as of right now.

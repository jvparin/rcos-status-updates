## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Being new to Venue, I initially had trouble building the project on my local machine due to dependency issues in the node modules \
> when npm installing. I solved this by deleting the node modules directory on my local repo and redoing the npm installation, and \
> it worked! I also had issues serving with gulp serve, but solved it by installing Python 2.7 on my local machine (some dependency \
> used Python 2.7 and not Python 3). I also looked at tutorials on the MEAN stack (e.g. https://www.djamware.com/post/5b00bb9180aca726dee1fd6d/mean-stack-angular-6-crud-web-application) \
> as I have never used this type of stack. I thought it was interesting how Mongoose can create schema models for Mongo instead of manually
> making the data models in MongoDB.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to continue learning the MEAN stack and the codebase of Venue. \
> I also plan to look at easy issues that I can possibly fix that are listed on Github.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> There is nothing blocking me as of right now.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

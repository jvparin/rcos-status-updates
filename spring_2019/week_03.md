## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I mainly learned the MEAN stack and have a good general idea of how it works. I even made a sample CRUD app using the stack that adds, deletes, and updates contacts in a contact list. Check it out here: https://github.com/jvparin/mean-stack-sample-app
I was also looking at the current issues in the Venue repository to see if there is any of them that I can work on and fix. Issues #498, #499, and #503 seem feasible for me to do. I added another issue to the list that states that I was unable to create a new course as an admin for some odd reason: https://github.com/rcos/venue/issues/509


## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to work on fixing at least one of the issues #498, #499, and #503, and create a pull request for it.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

There is nothing blocking me as of right now.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I have no extra notes as of right now.
